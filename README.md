## General Policies

- This is not a democracy. This project reflects *my* vision of what an MMO strategy game should be. Everyone who shares that vision is welcome. Suggestions are always appreciated, but the final decision is mine.
- Please **read and follow** the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.
- English is the main language of the project to enable contributions from people around the world.

## To-Do List

- Add a README in the `setup` folder to explain how to deploy the web portal
- Refactor code for better readability and easier collaboration
- Audit and improve the security of the entire authentication process

## Purpose

**KlodWeb** is the main entry point to access the game. It handles player accounts, subscriptions, payments, and connections to world servers.

It is intended to have a minimalistic interface, available in English and French (later: Spanish and Chinese), allowing users to register and get a basic introduction to the game. It will also include:
- A video to present the project
- A link to a Wiki for gameplay details

## Setup

See the `README.md` file in the [`setup`](./setup) folder for installation instructions.
